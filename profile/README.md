Welcome to [Aqueduct Fluidics](https://wp.aqueductfluidics.com)'s GitHub repository collection! 

## Repository Breakdown

This is a selection of the repositories that we think might be most interesting to our users.

1. [Example Projects](#example-projects)
2. [Project Templates](#project-templates)

### Example Projects

The best way to get started with the Aqueduct platform is to see examples of code! These repositories contain Libraries, 
Recipes, and Setups targeted to specific applications, like control of pH, automation of a filtration process, automated dispensing, etc. Expect
the list to grow.

- [example-projects](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/example_projects) - Example Projects
  - [pH-control](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/example_projects/tree/main/local/lib/ph_control) - Library that includes PID and On-Off control algorithms
    for maintaining the pH of a vessel by addition of a base. 

### Project Templates

Ready to create your own Library? The best way to get started is to <b>clone</b> (ie, copy) a template and then modify 
the code in your favorite editor to make it work for your application.

- [template-project](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/template_project) - This is a reusable skeleton that we use to start a new project. It's not canon, but it's a good starting point...

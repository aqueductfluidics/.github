Welcome to the [Aqueduct Fluidics](https://docs.aqueductfluidics.com) GitHub repository collection! 

To install the desktop Aqueduct Application, following the instructions [here](https://docs.aqueductfluidics.com/docs/installation/install.html).

## Repository Breakdown

1. [**aqueduct-py** Python API](#aqueduct-py) 
2. [Example Projects](#aqueduct-py-examples)

### Example Projects

The best way to get started with the Aqueduct platform is to see examples of code! These repositories contain Libraries, 
Recipes, and Setups targeted to specific applications, like control of pH, automation of a filtration process, automated dispensing, etc. 

- [Install the Aqueduct Application](https://docs.aqueductfluidics.com/docs/installation/install.html)

- [aqueduct-py](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py) - The **aqueduct-py** Python API for writing Recipes 

- [aqueduct-py-examples](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py-examples) - Example Projects
  - [Filtration](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py-examples/tree/main/apps/filtration) - Library that includes model files and recipes for tangential flow filtration. 
  - [pH Control](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py-examples/tree/main/apps/ph_control) - Library that includes PID and On-Off control algorithms
    for maintaining the pH of a solution by addition of a base.
  - [Dispensing](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py-examples/tree/main/apps/dispensing) - Library that includes model files and recipes for controlling a series of syringe pumps for variable rate, timed dispensing for formulation studies.

### Project Templates

Ready to create your own Library? The best way to get started is to <b>clone</b> (ie, copy) a template and then modify 
the code in your favorite editor to make it work for your application.

- [template-project](https://github.com/aqueductfluidics/aqueduct-py-examples/tree/main/apps/template) - This is a reusable skeleton that we use to start a new project.
